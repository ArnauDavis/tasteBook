  --clarification incoming(just didn't stop working so no clarification needed)

--find/make route for poster of post to be a link

--make images on feed and profile same size in 2 order columns 

--turn actual post user id into user name (actually wasn't too bad and I even realized I can get the actual poster user info too, how cool)
